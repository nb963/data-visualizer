Software Assessment for Investure

This is a project that visualizes the data in the excel sheet provided by Investure for the Software Intern Assessment. The data provided describes the daily returns of the S&P 500 Total Return Index. From the following data, I have created a visualizer that calculates and visulaizes the total returns up till that day using a line chart.

In this project, I have used HTML/CSS and JavaScript. In JavaScript, I have used the ChartJS library to create a line chart depicting the data.
